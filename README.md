# ruby-hint

Hint CLI tool rewritten in Ruby. 'hint' started off as a python project to help me learn python, with the benefit that the output was a useful-to-me tool to get my personal hints directly on the command line. I'm working with a predominantly Ruby development team at the moment so I'm re-writing this tool in Ruby as an exercise in learning Ruby, also with the benefit of being a real project rather than a set of theoretical coding exercises.

## CLI

The mechanics of a cli are not key for me, so I'll try https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-cli/0.6/ and see how this works.
